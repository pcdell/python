#1. Assume the days of the week are numbered 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 from Sunday to Saturday. Write a program that asks a
#     day number, and prints the day name (a string).
#2. You go on a wonderful holiday (perhaps to jail, if you donâ€™t like happy exercises) leaving on day number 3
#     (a Wednesday). You return home after 137 sleeps. Write a general version of the program which asks for the starting
#     day number, and the length of your stay, and it will tell you the name of day of the week you will return on.
